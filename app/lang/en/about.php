	'biography' => "
	<p>I've been working in webdevelopment for nearly :work years now, with a big part of my experience working at <span itemprop='worksFor'>:stappler</span>.
	I made my first steps in this field with just a small knowledge of it, and from project to project it quickly became my passion. I know accept the web world for all its standards and challenges – be it front-end technologies (<strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> or <strong>Javascript</strong>) or back-end (<strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> with a strong taste for <strong>OOP</strong> and various frameworks).</p>
	<p>I'm serious, dedicated, and up to date on the latest moves in a field changing day after day. To stay relevant I follow a number of designers and developpers on social networks like :twitter.<br>I want to understand, and not just copy/paste – I don't want to just do my job, I want to do it <em>well</em>.</p>
	<p>I'm neck-deep in the <strong>open-source</strong> community, with a big number of projects and libraries myself on major websites like :github or :bitbucket. This proximity to other developpers allows me to participate in the development of tools and frameworks I use, to make them better or event to create new ones.</p>",
