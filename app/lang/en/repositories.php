			A set of projects and libraries I created along my work. Most of them packages for the :laravel framework or agnostic packages distributed for :composer.
		</p>
		<p>
			All are in PHP - although my skills include other languages - I mostly had the occasion to create packages. The Laravel being one of the new major framework in the PHP scene, there was a lack of available plugins I could fill.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being really strict about staying up to date when you're either a wedevelopper or webdesigner, all of my libraries follow the :psr standards
			and use the latest possibilities of OOP brought by the newest versions of PHP.
